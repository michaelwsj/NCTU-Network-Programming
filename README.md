# Network Programming Course in NCTU
The course was lectured by Prof. Shie-Yuan Wang at CS @ NCTU in 2016 Fall.

## Introduction
The repository is just to record my programs related to network programming during the course. The programs mostly focus on network communication and web services such as chatroom, cloud drive, etc.

There might be some bugs in the codes needed to be corrected, or the programs might not be such efficient. But just as what mentioned before, it is simply my learning record.

## Programs
There are three main assignments and one midterm recorded in the course. Each program is placed with `spec.pdf` or `spec.pptx` which gives a full specification.

Subjects of programs are listed as follow.
* Multi-client Chatroom
* Cloud Drive
* UDP Reliable File Transfer
* Non-blocking File Transfer
